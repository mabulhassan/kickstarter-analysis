# kickstarter-analysis
## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of the Kickstart analysis is to summarize the data of the campaign and create a visual representation of the outcome based on goals and Launch date.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The month of May had the best successful outcome. In the months from May and September, the success rate was declining with December being the lowest success outcome.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The most sucessful campaign is the one with a goal under $1000 and the least successful campaign was the one with more than $50,000.
The success rate was picking up again for goals in the middle range between $25,000 and $40,000 but declined again for goals over $40,000.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Formatting the charts to simplify the graph visuals.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The success rate is small towards the beginning and end of the launch date for the campaign and is higher in the middle of the year before it starts to decline.
The success rate varies based on the category measured.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Campaigns with a low goal amounts have a better success rate than compaigns with very high goal amounts.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The dataset is limited in that it is not current and does not go back in time long enough to take into consideration other factors that may impact the success rate.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
The time range between the launch date and deadline and its impact on the outcome.
The difference between the pledged amount and goal for successful campaign outcomes.
